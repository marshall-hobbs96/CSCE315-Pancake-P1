## SCRUM Practices

For this project, we will follow the SCRUM Practices presented by Dr. Daugherty in class.
This includes writing a product backlog and burn-down chart, dividing the project into sprints,
and setting up SCRUM meetings. This document (created 10/20/2018) will keep track of all four
of these items as the project progresses.

### Product Backlog

based on [this](https://www.scrum-institute.org/The_Scrum_Product_Backlog.php) (items with a low priority value have high priority)

> These are very rough and do not cover all the detail of everything the user should expect. Feel free to add to it.

| Priority | Story | Estimated Time (days) |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | I need to see a splash screen when the program boots up | 2 |
| 1 | I need to be able to choose how many pancakes to flip and the difficulty of my opponent before the game starts | 2 |
| 1 | I need to be able to choose an order for the pancake stacks before the game or choose a random order | 2|
| 1 | I should be able to see the high scores as I enter my initials before the game starts | 2 |
| 2 | When the game starts, I should see my pancake stack along with the AI's so I can choose one | 4 |
| 2 | When the AI makes a move, I need to know what the AI player did | 2 |
| 3 | I should know when the game is over and what my score is | 5 |
| 4 | After the game, I want to see the score I got and have the option to start a new game | 3 |

### Burn-Down Chart

### Sprints

**Sprint 1:** Design Documents and Project Framework

For week 1, we should focus on gaining a clear picture of the project as a whole and preparing to practice SCRUM. We should set up this document as well as a document for our test-driven development. We will also finish and submit a set of design documents. This way, our customers can see that we have a functioning plan for how to execute the game.

**Sprint 2:** Framework Code

For week 2, we will focus on making the first few screens in the game appear without failure. We will make sure that all product backlog items marked priority 2 are complete so that the game player can see a splash screen as well as screens that allow them to customize the game and enter their username before starting. We will need to configure the first 4 tasks mentioned in the instructions for this project. When these screens are done, the screen will show everything received from the user and print that the game is over.

**Sprint 3:** Functioning Game

By the end of week 3 (Nov. 3), we should have a fully functional game that allows the user to play until the game is over and repeat as necessary. The game should be easy for people with no programming experience to play so that it can be tested the weekend of Nov. 3 by non-CS majors for major fixes that need to happen that weekend before the Nov. 5 deadline.

### SCRUM Meetings

15 Minute meeetings to review priorities mentioned (should mostly come from the Product backlog). Will be filled in and added to as we go.
