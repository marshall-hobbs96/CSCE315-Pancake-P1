## SCRUM Practices

For this project, we will follow the SCRUM Practices presented by Dr. Daugherty in class.
This includes writing a product backlog and burn-down chart, dividing the project into sprints,
and setting up SCRUM meetings. This document (created 10/20/2018) will keep track of all four
of these items as the project progresses.

### Backlog

based on [this](https://www.scrum-institute.org/The_Scrum_Product_Backlog.php) (items with a low priority value have high priority)

> These are very rough and do not cover all the detail of everything the user should expect. Feel free to add to it.

| Item | Sprint | Assignee |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| I need to see a splash screen when the program boots up | 1 | Troy |
| Show a game being played in the background of the splash screen | Troy |
| I need to be able to choose how many pancakes to flip and the difficulty of my opponent before the game starts | 1 | McLain |
| I need to be able to choose an order for the pancake stacks before the game or choose a random order | 1 | Marshall |
| I should be able to see the high scores as I enter my initials before the game starts | 1 | Abdul |
| Drawing a pancake stack function | 2 | Marshall |
| When the game starts, I should see my pancake stack along with the AI's so I can choose one | 2 | ? | 
| Choosing AI difficulty and using a search tree with a variable depth to modify AI difficulty | 2 | ? | 
| Display minimum number of moves required to solve current stack | 2 | ? | 
| When a player/AI makes a move, I need to know what the player/AI did (make move function). Should be able to choose flip location with ASWD or arrow keys, then pancakes above flip location blink for 3 seconds, then new stack is drawn| 3 | ? |
| Checking if win conditions are met after each move | 1 | ? |
| Ability for player to ask for hint | 2 | ? |
| I should know when the game is over and what my score is | 1 | ? |
| Ability to check/display high scores and save new highscores to file | 1 | ? |
| After the game, I want to see the score I got and have the option to start a new game | 1 | ? |

### Sprints

**Sprint 1: 10/11 - 10/18** 
Design Documents and Project Framework

For week 1, we should focus on gaining a clear picture of the project as a whole and preparing to practice SCRUM. We should set up this document as well as a document for our test-driven development. We will also finish and submit a set of design documents. This way, our customers can see that we have a functioning plan for how to execute the game.

**Sprint 2: 10/18 - 10/23** 
Framework Code

For week 2, we will focus on making the first few screens in the game appear without failure. We will make sure that all product backlog items marked priority 2 are complete so that the game player can see a splash screen as well as screens that allow them to customize the game and enter their username before starting. We will need to configure the first 4 tasks mentioned in the instructions for this project. When these screens are done, the screen will show everything received from the user and print that the game is over.

**Sprint 3: 10/23 - 10/29** 
Functioning Game

By the end of this sprint, we should have a fully functional game that allows the user to play until the game is over and repeat as necessary. The game does not have to be as robust as possible, but tests should be written (and sometimes failing) for edge cases. The game should run to completion if the user does everything they are supposed to, even if the screen does not look very pretty and easy to use for people without computer experience. Someone else in our CSCE315 class should be able to play.

**Sprint 4: 10/29 - 11/3**
Quality Game

Focus for this sprint is on designing the game to produce quality (blinking, etc.) screens that make the UI simple and straightforward. At the end of the sprint, anyone should be able to play intuitively without the program crashing. No extra functionality should be added yet.

**Sprint 5: 11/3 - 11/5**
Quality Testing

This weekend will be for handing the game off to someone who does not have a computer background to see if they can easily play or crash the program. If we manage to finish this early, we can think about adding mor functionality to the game.

### SCRUM Meetings

15 Minute meeetings to review priorities mentioned (should mostly come from the Product backlog). Will be filled in and added to as we go.
